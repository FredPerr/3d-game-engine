 * The <strong>Event</strong> abstract class is a part of

 * {@link engine.event.Event} class and be instantiated
 * before the loop of the engine starts. The event needs
 * to be in a class otherwise, it will not be stored. Each
 * class that inherit this class should have the variables
 * that are edited, a {@code setValues(...)} method with
 * the variables edited in parameter to redefine them
 * before every call of the event. They should have
 * getters to get the variables edited.
